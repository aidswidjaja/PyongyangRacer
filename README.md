## Developer instructions

Unfortunately, it is a Flash game and we all know what happened to that... Furthermore, it doesn't even appear it has been archived in [Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/). The only copy I could find is this one on [swfchan](http://swfchan.com/29/143906/?Pyongyang+Racer+-+Koryo+Tours.swf) which has incorrect metadata, has a corrupt screenshot, and was last seen online in 2014.

The `.swf` file is served publicly from the website at `http://www.pyongyangracer.co/PYracer.swf`, however Microsoft IIS/8.5 doesn't like serving `.swf` files and throws a 403 Forbidden error. There was no easy way to get hold of the `.swf` file. This means that should the website go down, all traces of Pyongyang Racer could be lost, or buried deep in the web without any easy way of getting to it. Which is why I have taken it upon myself to serve my comrades and preserve this beautiful game! (Also my Modern History class has been meming over it so yea that too).

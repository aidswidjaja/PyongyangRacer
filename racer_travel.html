 (Koryo Group) is a British-run company based in Beijing specialising in
 DPRK (North  Korea) Travel, Cultural Exchange, Sport projects, Art, 
Film and Publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> We  are very proud of the work we do in Korea and our expertise is 
based on the  visits we have made to the country every month since 
1993.&nbsp; Koryo Tours are recognised as being the only  North Korea 
travel specialists and provide tourists and North Koreans alike  with 
the greatest opportunity of exchange. Our cultural projects have the  
support of the British Government. We believe passionately in engagement
 and  from the impact that our various projects have had on the ground 
in Korea we  need no other vindication of this approach. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Koryo Group we thrive on  exchanging&nbsp; ideas to give the North
  Korean people the opportunities that interaction brings. Whether you 
are simply  wanting to visit the country, hold a sporting event, art 
show, film screening,  or if you just want to know more then please 
contact us. We love a challenge  and our list of achievements are 
testament to both our efforts and expertise as  well as that of our 
Korean partners. This list includes; the first western  documentaries 
filmed in the DPRK, opening up new tourist destinations, sports  
exchanges, the first ever nationwide screening of a Western feature 
film, the  first co-production of a romantic comedy feature film, being 
the first travel  company to take in over 2,000 tourists a year, 
commissioning the first pieces  of art for international exhibitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> These all make up the first small steps to  engagement. You can find more information at: <a href="http://www.koryogroup.com/">www.koryogroup.com</a> but we would  love to hear from you directly with any questions at: <a href="mailto:info@koryogroup.com">info@koryogroup.com&nbsp; </a></p>
